Artifact Configuration
Artifact Name: Real-Time Incident Detection and Response (RTIDR)
Description: Automates the detection, analysis, and response to potential security incidents using VQL.
Inputs:
event_timestamp: Timestamp of the log event.
source_ip: Source IP address of the event.
destination_ip: Destination IP address of the event.
event_type: Type of event (e.g., 'unauthorized_access', 'data_exfiltration', 'malware_detection', 'login').
event_details: Details of the event.
Outputs:
Detected potential incidents.
Real-time alerts for significant incidents.
Automated incident reports.
Alerts: Configurable thresholds for different types of incidents (e.g., unauthorized access, data exfiltration).
Benefits of RTIDR Artifact
Efficiency Gains:

Automated Processes: Significantly reduces the time spent on manual data collection, aggregation, and analysis.
Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous monitoring allows for immediate detection of potential incidents.
Improved Accuracy:

Dynamic Thresholds: Context-aware detection rules reduce false positives and enhance the accuracy of incident detection.
Comprehensive Analysis: Aggregates data from multiple sources for a holistic view of security events.
Faster Incident Response:

Real-Time Alerts: Immediate notification of potential incidents enables faster response and mitigation.
Automated Reporting: Generates incident reports automatically, providing timely insights for decision-making.
Better Resource Allocation:

Focused Investigation: Analysts can focus on high-priority incidents identified by the system, rather than sifting through all logs manually.
Strategic Response: Enables more strategic allocation of resources based on the severity and type of incidents detected.
Summary
The Real-Time Incident Detection and Response (RTIDR) artifact enhances the DFIR process by automating key tasks, improving accuracy, and enabling faster response times. This integration ensures a more efficient workflow, better detection of potential security incidents, and timely incident response, ultimately strengthening the organization's security posture.
